# Alarm Clock Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented an alarm clock using Python. I used the libraries tkinter, datetime, time and winsound which helped me to build the project using the current date and time as well as to provide a user interface to set the alarm according to a 24-hour format.

### Results:

First, I created the alarm loop. The loop will initially let the user know what the current time is.

Then let the user set his alarm. When the alarm equals the current time, a message will be displayed onto the terminal and a sound will be played.

This is possible because I set the variable to accept input of strings.

In addition, I set an exit and reset condition for the GUI application.

Afterwards, I created the GUI (graphic user interface) so the user can interact with the code above.

**Sets the title and dimensions of the UI application**

**Sets the words seen on the application as well as provides the area to place inputs in**

**Sets the buttons the user can press**

Finally, I closed the mainloop which is the last command given to compile all the previous commands and displays the window as soon as the program is running.
