# Alarm Clock Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented an alarm clock using Python. I used the libraries tkinter, datetime, time and winsound which helped me to build the project using the current date and time as well as to provide a user interface to set the alarm according to a 24-hour format.

### Explanation:

First, I import all the necessary libraries and modules:

Afterwards, I create created the alarm while loop. The loop will first let the user know what the current time is.

Then let the user set his alarm.

This is possible becuase I set the variable to accept input of strings.

 I also set an exit and reset condition for the GUI application.

Afterwards I created the GUI (graphic user interface) so the user can interact with the code above.

Finally, I closed the mainloop which is the last command given to compile all the previous commands and displays the window as soon as the program is running.
